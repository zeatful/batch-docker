# We added a VOLUME pointing to "/tmp" because that is where a Spring Boot application creates working directories for Tomcat by default.
# The effect is to create a temporary file on your host under "/var/lib/docker" and link it to the container under "/tmp". This step is optional for
# the simple app that we wrote here, but can be necessary for other Spring Boot applications if they need to actually write in the filesystem.
VOLUME /tmp
ADD batch-docker-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar app.jar

# You can use a RUN command to "touch" the jar file so that it has a file modification time (Docker creates all container files in an "unmodified" state
# by default). This actually isnâ€™t important for the simple app that we wrote, but any static content (e.g. "index.html") would require the file to have
# a modification time.
RUN sh -c 'touch /app.jar'
ENV JAVA_OPTS=""

# To reduce Tomcat startup time we added a system property pointing to "/dev/urandom" as a source of entropy.
